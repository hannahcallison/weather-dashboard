# Weather Dashboard

## Introduction

For this project we were asked to make a weather dashboard using third-party APIs. Open Weather One Call API fetches current status and five day weather statuses for cities that users search for. By properly fetching the data we were assinged to display the weather information to the page for the user to see. 

## Webpage Ability
Using dynamically updated HTML and CSS bootstrap alongside the weather one call API when the user enters the webpage they can search for a city in the input bar. Once they hit submit the current weather data and 5 day weather status is displayed on the page. A button is also added to the side to save their search history. Using localStorage, when they click the button with the citys name the page is repopulated with that citys weather information.
